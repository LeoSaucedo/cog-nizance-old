# Act 0 - A New Beginning

#### Season - Winter

`[AS] =` *The game intro animation plays, possibly with Lexi reading the intro.*

`[AS] =` *The screen fades from black to the image of the main character, Ashira, waking up in the floor of a faded, mostly destroyed convenience store. She has a small, faded backpack next to her. She picks up the backpack.*

`(Box 1):` Ashira: "..."

`(Box 2):` Ashira: "Wh-where am I?"

`[AS] =`*The platform-specific controls for moving Ashira around appear.*

`(Box 1):` Ashira: So...hungry...

`[AS] =` *The PH bar appears, indicating it as red and blinking. Ashira can regain health by walking over food items, which now appear to be scattered around the convenience store.

Additionally, a flashlight is lying behind the convenience store counter, which Ashira has to pick up.

When Ashira regains her full health and picks up the flashlight, an arrow appears, directing her to exit the building.

The "open-world" nature of the game is revealed as Ashira is now able to move freely around the world.*

`(Box 1):` Ashira: What is this place? I don't remember...
